## Question 1: Does Seasonality Play a Role in CPL and Volume of Leads?

### Findings:

**YES - Strong seasonality patterns are evident in both lead volume and CPL.**

#### Lead Volume Seasonality:
- **Peak Months:** June (88 leads) and May (74 leads) - representing 26% of annual leads
- **Low Months:** July and September (32 leads each)
- **Pattern:** Gradual increase from July through December, slight dip in January-February, then significant surge in May-June, this also makes sense because most of the school programs start from late july to late august and people have already been enrolled in schools by then 

#### CPL Seasonality:
- **Highest CPL:** June ($165.01) and May ($160.91) - peak months have highest costs
- **Lowest CPL:** July ($38.82) and March ($65.49)
- **Pattern:** CPL increases dramatically during peak lead months, suggesting increased competition or market dynamics

### Key Insights:
1. **Inverse Relationship:** Peak lead months (May-June) coincide with highest CPL, indicating increased competition during application season
2. **Summer Opportunity:** July shows lowest CPL ($38.82) but also low volume (32 leads), suggesting potential for optimization
3. **Q4 Performance:** October-December show moderate performance with CPL ranging $83-$120

### Actionable Recommendations:
1. **Budget Reallocation:** Shift 40-50% of Q4 budget to May-June period to capitalize on peak demand
2. **Early Bird Strategy:** Increase spend in March-April to capture early applicants before peak competition
3. **Summer Optimization:** Test increased spend in July-August when CPL is lowest to improve efficiency

## Question 5: Are There Trends of Increased Ad Engagements and Increased Leads in Following Periods?

### Findings:

**YES - Strong positive correlations exist between ad engagements and leads in subsequent periods.**

### Correlation Analysis:

| Metric | 1-Week Lag | 2-Week Lag |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Link Clicks → Leads | **0.651** | 0.532 |
| Landing Page Views → Leads | **0.661** | 0.532 |

### Key Insights:

1. **Strong Delayed Conversion Pattern:** Both clicks and LPVs show strong correlation (0.65+) with leads one week later
2. **Decision-Making Timeline:** Prospective students take approximately 1 week from engagement to submission
3. **Engagement Quality Indicator:** High engagement weeks predict lead generation in following weeks
4. **Diminishing Effect:** 2-week lag shows weaker correlation, indicating most conversions happen within 1 week

### Monthly Trend Analysis:

**Peak Engagement Months:**
- May: Highest clicks and LPVs, followed by June peak in leads
- December: High engagement, followed by January lead peak

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Engagement spikes precede lead spikes by 2-4 weeks
- Seasonal application deadlines drive this pattern
- Marketing efforts create awareness that converts later

### Actionable Recommendations for Media Planning Team:

#### 1. **Engagement-Based Budget Allocation:**
   - **Increase spend during high-engagement periods** to maximize delayed conversions
   - Allocate 30% more budget to weeks showing above-average engagement
   - Use engagement metrics as leading indicators for budget adjustments

#### 2. **Predictive Budgeting Model:**
   - Implement a rolling 2-week engagement forecast
   - Increase budget when engagement exceeds 1.2x weekly average
   - Reduce budget when engagement drops below 0.8x weekly average

#### 3. **Campaign Timing Strategy:**
   - **Pre-Peak Investment:** Increase spend 2-3 weeks before known application deadlines
   - **Sustained Engagement:** Maintain consistent spend during high-engagement periods rather than reactive increases
   - **Early Season Push:** Invest heavily in March-April to capture early applicants before May-June competition

#### 4. **Measurement Framework:**
   - Track engagement-to-lead conversion windows by program
   - Set up automated alerts for engagement spikes
   - Create dashboard showing engagement trends vs. lead trends with lag indicators

#### 5. **Budget Reallocation Formula:**
   ```
   Weekly Budget Multiplier = 1 + (Engagement Index - 1) × 0.5
   Where Engagement Index = Current Week Engagement / 4-Week Average
   ```
