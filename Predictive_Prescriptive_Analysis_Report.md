## Part 1: Predictive Analysis

### 1.1 Lead Volume & CPL Forecasting

**Methodology:** Time series forecasting using linear regression with seasonal adjustments based on historical patterns.

**Forecasted Performance (Jul-Dec 2025):**

| Month | Forecasted Leads | Forecasted CPL | Trend |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| July 2025 | 26 | $181.18 | Low volume, high CPL |
| August 2025 | 42 | $113.08 | Moderate performance |
| September 2025 | 25 | $184.14 | Low volume, high CPL |
| October 2025 | 32 | $139.89 | Moderate performance |
| November 2025 | 25 | $176.90 | Low volume, high CPL |
| December 2025 | 44 | $98.06 | **Best opportunity** |

**Key Insights:**
- **December 2025** shows the best forecasted performance (44 leads, $98.06 CPL)
- **September and November** are forecasted to have lowest volumes with highest CPL
- Seasonal patterns continue into FY2025, with Q4 (Oct-Dec) showing better performance than Q1 (Jul-Sep)

**Actionable Recommendations:**
1. **Increase December budget** by 20-30% to capitalize on forecasted strong performance
2. **Reduce spend in September and November** when CPL is forecasted to be highest
3. **Test early optimization** in July-August to improve forecasted low performance

### 1.2 Program Performance Prediction

**Methodology:** Predictive modeling based on historical CPL and conversion rates, assuming 10% improvement through optimization.

**Predicted Program Performance (with optimization):**

| Program | Historical CPL | Predicted CPL | Predicted Leads* | Predicted ROI |
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| MS in Management | $58.97 | $53.07 | 25 | **0.0170** ⭐ |
| Bachelors of Science in Engineering | $77.38 | $69.65 | 393 | **0.0129** ⭐ |
| Bachelors of Science in Aerospace | $83.06 | $74.75 | 374 | 0.0120 |
| Military Focused Campaign | $95.77 | $86.19 | 401 | 0.0104 |
| Masters of Space Operations | $98.94 | $89.05 | 434 | 0.0101 |
| MBA Airlines | $101.09 | $90.98 | 347 | 0.0099 |
| MS in Engineering Management | $177.39 | $159.65 | 147 | 0.0056 |

*Based on current spend levels

**Key Insights:**
- **MS in Management** shows highest ROI potential (0.0170) but low volume due to limited historical data
- **Bachelors of Science in Engineering** offers best balance of volume (393 leads) and ROI (0.0129)
- **MS in Engineering Management** remains challenging with highest CPL even after optimization

**Actionable Recommendations:**
1. **Increase investment** in top ROI programs (MS in Management, BSE) if volume can be scaled
2. **Optimize MSEM** campaign strategy before increasing budget
3. **Test Masters of Space Operations** with new strategy before full reallocation

## Part 2: Prescriptive Analysis

### 2.1 Optimal Budget Allocation Models

Three optimization scenarios were developed to guide budget allocation decisions:

#### Scenario 1: Maximize Lead Volume
**Objective:** Allocate budget to maximize total lead generation

**Results:**
- **Total Predicted Leads:** 1,900 (vs. current 619)
- **Improvement:** +206.9%
- **Key Changes:**
  - Increase MS in Management: $1,500 → $28,750 (+1,816%)
  - Increase Military Campaign: $38,403 → $32,876 (-14%)
  - Increase BSE: $30,397 → $31,926 (+5%)

**Trade-offs:** Higher lead volume but potentially higher average CPL

#### Scenario 2: Optimize CPL
**Objective:** Minimize average cost per lead

**Results:**
- **Average CPL:** Reduced through reallocation to low-CPL programs
- **Key Changes:**
  - Increase MS in Management: $1,500 → $40,596 (+2,606%)
  - Increase BSE: $30,397 → $30,938 (+2%)
  - Reduce MSEM: $26,086 → $13,496 (-48%)

**Trade-offs:** Lower CPL but potentially lower total volume

#### Scenario 3: Balanced Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Objective:** Optimize both lead volume and CPL efficiency

**Results:**
- **Total Predicted Leads:** 1,890 (vs. current 619)
- **Improvement:** +205.3%
- **Key Changes:**
  - Increase MS in Management: $1,500 → $28,123 (+1,775%)
  - Increase Military Campaign: $38,403 → $32,918 (-14%)
  - Increase BSE: $30,397 → $31,598 (+4%)
  - Reduce MSEM: $26,086 → $18,897 (-28%)

**Why Recommended:** Best balance between volume and efficiency, realistic implementation

**Actionable Recommendations:**
1. **Implement Balanced Approach** for FY2025 budget allocation
2. **Test MS in Management** with increased budget to validate predicted performance

### 2.3 ROI Optimization Model

**Methodology:** Tested ROI performance across different budget levels (80% to 120% of optimal allocation)

**Results:**

| Budget Level | Total Budget | Total Leads | Avg CPL | ROI |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|---------|-----|
| 80% | $130,025 | 1,512 | $85.99 | 0.0116 |
| 90% | $146,278 | 1,701 | $85.99 | 0.0116 |
| 100% | $162,531 | 1,890 | $85.99 | 0.0116 |
| 110% | $178,784 | 2,079 | $85.99 | 0.0116 |
| 120% | $195,037 | 2,268 | $85.99 | 0.0116 |

**Key Insights:**
- **ROI remains constant** (0.0116) across all budget levels
- **Linear scaling:** Each 10% budget increase yields ~189 additional leads
- **Optimal budget range:** $162,531 - $178,784 (100-110% level)

**Actionable Recommendations:**
1. **Target budget:** $162,531 - $178,784 for optimal ROI
2. **Scale linearly:** Budget increases directly translate to lead increases
